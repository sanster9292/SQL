* This is the code I wrote to create a database using MYSQL. 
* The purpose of this database is to keep record of all the books that i read.
* There are four columns in this database titled ID|Author|Genre|Thoughts
* ID is generated automatically to serve as a primary key.
  Author is the name of the author(s).
  Genre takes upto three descriptive genres that each book might fit into.
  Thoughts takes quick musings that I had about the book.
